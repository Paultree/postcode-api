- We want you to implement:
  - An API that allows mobile clients to retrieve the suburb information by postcode.
  - An API that allows mobile clients to retrieve a postcode given a suburb name
- A secured API to add new suburb and postcode combinations (you'll have to work out how this should work)
- Some form of persistence (a database)
- Testing for controller / service layers
